## ü§ù Contributing

We welcome contributions to expand the collection of payment plugins! If you've developed a payment plugin for Medusa.js, we'd love to include it in this repository. Here's how you can contribute:

1. Fork the repository
2. Create a new branch for your plugin
3. Add your plugin to the `packages` directory
4. Include comprehensive documentation
5. Submit a pull request

### Guidelines for New Payment Plugins

- Follow the existing plugin structure
- Include TypeScript types
- Provide clear documentation
- Include tests
- Follow Medusa.js plugin conventions

## üíª Development

This repository uses:
- Yarn workspaces for package management
- Turborepo for build system
- TypeScript for type safety
- ESLint and Prettier for code formatting

## üß™ Testing

This repository includes comprehensive end-to-end (e2e) tests using Cypress to ensure the payment integration flows work correctly.

### Prerequisites

Before running the e2e tests, make sure you have:

1. **Docker and Docker Compose** installed and running
2. **Node.js** (version 18 or higher)
3. **Yarn** package manager

### Setting Up the Test Environment

1. **Start the development environment:**
   ```bash
   # Install dependencies
   yarn install
   
   # Start all services (Medusa backend, database, Redis, etc.)
   yarn dev
   ```

2. **Seed the database with test data:**
   ```bash
   # Navigate to the test-server package
   cd packages/test-server
   
   # Run database migrations and seed with test data
   npx medusa db:migrate
   npx medusa exec ./src/scripts/seed.ts
   ```
   
   This will create:
   - Sample products (T-Shirt, Sweatshirt, Sweatpants, Shorts)
   - Product categories and variants
   - Shipping options and regions
   - Payment providers configuration
   - Inventory levels
   - API keys and sales channels

3. **Verify services are running:**
   - Medusa backend should be running on `http://localhost:9000`
   - Storefront should be running on `http://localhost:8000`
   - Database and Redis should be running via Docker

### Running E2E Tests

The e2e tests are located in `packages/storefront/cypress/e2e/` and test the complete checkout flow including payment processing.

#### Option 1: Run Tests in Headless Mode (CI/CD)
```bash
# Navigate to the storefront package
cd packages/storefront

# Run tests in headless mode
yarn cypress:run
```

#### Option 2: Open Cypress Test Runner (Interactive)
```bash
# Navigate to the storefront package
cd packages/storefront

# Open Cypress test runner
yarn cypress:open
```

This will open the Cypress Test Runner where you can:
- See all available test files
- Run tests individually or all at once
- Watch tests execute in real-time
- Debug and interact with the application during test execution

### Test Configuration

The Cypress configuration is located at `packages/storefront/cypress.config.ts` with the following settings:

- **Base URL**: `http://localhost:8000` (storefront)
- **Viewport**: 1280x720
- **Video Recording**: Disabled
- **Screenshots**: Enabled on failure
- **Default Timeout**: 10 seconds
- **Chrome Web Security**: Disabled (for iframe testing)

### Available Test Files

- `checkout.cy.ts` - Tests the complete checkout flow with Razorpay payment integration
  - Product selection and cart management
  - Address and shipping information
  - Payment method selection
  - Razorpay payment processing
  - Order confirmation

### Test Data and Environment

The tests use the following test data:
- **Product**: Sweatpants (first product in the store)
- **Size**: L
- **Shipping Address**: Mumbai, Maharashtra, India
- **Payment Method**: Razorpay UPI
- **Test UPI ID**: `gov@okaxis`

### Troubleshooting

#### Common Issues:

1. **Tests fail with "element not found" errors:**
   - Ensure the storefront is running on port 8000
   - Check that the Medusa backend is running on port 9000
   - Verify that test data is properly seeded

2. **No products appear in the store:**
   - Make sure you've run the database seeding script: `npx medusa exec ./src/scripts/seed.ts`
   - Check that the database migrations have been applied: `npx medusa db:migrate`
   - Verify the Medusa backend is running and connected to the database

3. **Razorpay iframe issues:**
   - The tests include specific handling for Razorpay iframes
   - Chrome Web Security is disabled to allow iframe interactions
   - Tests include appropriate wait times for iframe loading

4. **Payment processing timeouts:**
   - The tests include extended wait times for payment processing
   - If tests consistently timeout, consider increasing wait times in the test file

5. **Database connection issues:**
   - Ensure Docker containers are running: `docker-compose ps`
   - Restart services if needed: `yarn dev`
   - Check database logs: `docker-compose logs postgres`

#### Debug Mode:

To run tests with additional logging:
```bash
cd packages/storefront
ELECTRON_ENABLE_LOGGING=1 yarn cypress:run
```

### Continuous Integration

The e2e tests are designed to run in CI/CD environments. The headless mode (`cypress:run`) is optimized for automated testing pipelines.
